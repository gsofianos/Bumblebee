# Bumblebee

#### What bumblebee is 
Bumblebee is a minimalist radio player created for elementary OS.
It's easy to use, to the point and not bloated with features.

#### What bumblebee isn't 
Bumblebee is not a complex radio player app with several features
and it won't be. As a developer my time is limited and I need an
app that is going to work with as little maintance as possible.

## Overview

#### Find your favorite stations
By using 'radio-browser.info' your favorite stations are a click
away. Do you have a station that's not in the list ? Contribute
to 'radio-browser.info'

#### Add stations from the web
Bumblebee is using a 'webradio' url handler protocol to open
stations directly from the browser. 

#### Sound Indicator Integration
You can use the sound indicator to change stations and view
the current playing one.

#### Media Keys Bindings
Your keyboards media keys are working fine with bumblebee, try it!
